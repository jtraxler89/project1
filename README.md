Sample website for interesting things to do in Milwaukee for families and adults.

I am from Milwaukee, and no one seems to know how awesome it is, so this is hopefully a little taste to help show them. The city has almsot all the amenities of Chicago but is much smaller and cheaper, relieving many of the big city headaches. It is definitely a great place to take an long weekend during the summer. Unless you really like to drink though, there is less to do in the winter given the weather.
